Tentative outline based on things I have read:

Abstract: Lisp machines were purposed to run Lisp, etc. [needs reviewing]
Introduction: Explain the history of Lisp and Lisp machines [needs reviewing]
Body:
- Explain basics of some Lisp dialect (Common Lisp/Scheme).
- Discuss different ways in which Lisp machines were
  constructed such that they could run Lisp more efficiently.
  This should be the bulk of the paper.
- Applications (AI and single-person workstations)
- Legacy of Lisp machines.
